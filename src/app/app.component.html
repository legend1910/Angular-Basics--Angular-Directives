  1.Directives are instruction in the DOM. Ex : The components are such kind of directives for example : you are creating a compnonent with a selector and you are using it in the template you instructing Angular to add the content of the templated and the business logic in the typeScript  in the place where we use the selector.
  <br>
  2. Directives can be with or without template(Components are one kind of example for directive with template)
  <br>
  3. Predefined directives like ngif
  <br>
  4. * ng if is  a structure  directive where it changes the DOM i.e it adds a html element or it doesn't 
  <br>
  5. * is required without it it doesn't work
  </p>

  <h4>1.Using ngIf and else</h4>
  <input [(ngModel)]="name">
  <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="OnAddEvent()">Add</button>
  <!-- It Similar like Event Binding where within "" i.e *ngif="", you need have an expression or function call or a variable which returns boolean value-->
  <p *ngIf="isNameAdded">you have entered {{name}}</p>
  <p *ngIf="name!=''">you have a entered {{name}}</p>

  <!---using local refrence  for ngif else
  we need use ng-template here  and #NoName is a local refrence 
  -->
  <ng-template #NoName> <p>No Name Entered</p></ng-template>
  <p *ngIf="name!='' else NoName">the name you have entered is {{name}}</p>
